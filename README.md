Project Title: A bold and clear title.

Short Description: A one or two-sentence summary of what the project does.

Visuals: Start with a compelling image or a GIF of your simulation or dashboard. Visuals immediately grab attention.

Table of Contents: For a larger project, this helps people navigate easily.

1. Project Overview:

Explain the problem you're solving (inefficient HVAC systems).

State your solution (a Reinforcement Learning agent).

Clearly outline the project's goals (optimize for comfort and energy).

2. Methodology:

Mechanical & Simulation: Briefly describe the simulated "room" and the components (fan, heater).

Reinforcement Learning Model: Explain the AI framework (Agent, Environment, State, Actions, Rewards) in a simple, high-level way.

Data Flow Diagram: Include a simple block diagram showing how data from the sensors flows to the AI and back to the controls.

3. Results:

Learning Curve: Display the graph showing the AI's cumulative reward over time. This is a critical piece of evidence.

Performance Comparison: Show the graph comparing energy consumption between your AI system and a baseline rule-based system. Quantify the improvement (e.g., "AI system achieved a 15% reduction in energy usage").

Dashboard Mockup: Include a screenshot of your simulated dashboard to showcase the data visualization.

4. How to Run:

Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for someone to clone your repository and run the code. List any necessary dependencies (e.g., Python libraries like numpy, tensorflow, or scikit-learn).
