# AI-HVAC-OPTIMIZOR
This project presents a functional simulation of an intelligent HVAC system using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize performance. Unlike traditional rule-based thermostats, the self-learning agent autonomously manages room climate, balancing comfort and energy efficiency through continuous adaptation.
